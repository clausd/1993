* 'Nothing to implement' - server to serve as browser network state engine. 
* Replaces old school javascript-free REST with disciplined javascript-assisted REST, 
    The rule/goals:
      * HTML represents full application state, javascript is stateless, just adds behaviour
      * What 'HTML' is here can be made more sophisticated, i.e. we could implement templates,
      or allow HTML to actually mean 'the DOM'
* RPC is evil
